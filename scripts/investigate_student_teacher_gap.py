Investigate why Student outperforms Teacher
This should NEVER happen in knowledge distillation!

Possible causes:
1. Data leakage (test videos overlap with train)
2. Evaluation bug
3. Test set distribution different from train/val

Possible explanations for Student > Teacher:

1. **Data Leakage (MOST LIKELY)**
   - Video overlap between train and test
   - Frame-level leakage still present
   - Check: Are splits truly video-aware?

2. **Teacher Underfitting**
   - Teacher stopped at epoch 4 (best val F1)
   - Maybe more epochs needed?
   - Check: Teacher training curves

3. **Student Overfitting to Test**
   - Somehow student memorized test patterns
   - Less likely but possible
   - Check: Student validation F1 vs test F1

4. **Evaluation Bug**
   - Different preprocessing for teacher vs student
   - Check: eval code consistency

5. **Test Set Easier Than Val Set**
   - By chance, test videos are easier
   - Check: Distribution of fire/smoke in each split

Next steps:
1. Verify no video overlap between splits
2. Check teacher validation F1 from training logs
3. Compare val vs test distribution
4. Review evaluation code

print("""
Based on this analysis:

IF NO LEAKAGE:
  → Student legitimately learned better than teacher
  → This can happen if:
     * Teacher underfit (stopped too early)
     * Student architecture better suited
     * KD provided good regularization
  → ACCEPT the results

IF LEAKAGE FOUND:
  → Fix the video_aware_split implementation
  → Re-run all experiments
  → Expected: Teacher > Student (normal KD)

Check the training logs to compare:
  - Teacher VALIDATION F1 vs Teacher TEST F1
  - Student VALIDATION F1 vs Student TEST F1

If test >> validation for both, test set is just easier.
If test >> validation only for student, there's a problem.
